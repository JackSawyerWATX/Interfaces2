A number of inherited classes, some extending others implementing characteristics from one class to another.

Things to remember about interfaces and abstracts:

1) Interfaces solely define behavior, and abstract classes define behavior and characteristics.
2) A subclass can implement multiple interfaces, but you can extend only one class.
3) Interfaces cannot contain a constructor, while an Abstract Class can.
4) Classes implement interfaces; however, interfaces extend other interfaces.
